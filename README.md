This is a Minecraft Bedrock addon port of the famous WorldEdit mod for Minecraft: Java Edition. The addon comes with custom commands to make building easier, and more fun! Not only are there commands, but also items to make it easier for anyone on any device to use this.
__Please note that this addon is currently in its beta stage, and requires experimental features. To be on the safe side, make a backup of your world.__

## Installation
### Locally
First you must download the mcaddon file. You can find one in the [release section](https://github.com/SIsilicon/WorldEdit-BE/releases). After which, you open it with Minecraft and it will be imported into your game. Once there, choose a world you want to apply this addon to, and add the behaviour pack and resource pack together. The following experimental features must also be enabled.

And that's it! Your world is ready for WorldEdit.

### Aternos server
To properly add this addon to the server, you first need to upload an already existing world with the required experimental features enabled. You must then install the addon separately in the server's `packs` folder.

## Contribution
### Bug Report
If you've encountered a bug with the addon, please go [here](https://github.com/SIsilicon/WorldEdit-BE/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) submit one.

### Feature Request
The aim of this project is to replicate as many of the original WorldEdit features as possible, so if there's a feature you want that's in the original mod, it will likely be implemented anyway if possible.
However, you can still propose features that _aren't_ in the original mod, so long as you can make a case for how useful it can be. Then the proposal will be considered.

You submit proposals [here](https://github.com/SIsilicon/WorldEdit-BE/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Make sure that a similar proposal has not been made already.

## Special Thanks
The backbone of this addon's code is notbeer's [GameTest API Wrapper](https://github.com/notbeer/Gametest-API-Wrapper).

And thanks to the original creator of the WorldEdit mod "sk89q" and [EngineHub](https://enginehub.org/) as a whole. They developed and excellent mod, and I'm just simply making a version of it work on bedrock. They're the real heroes. :)
