This is a Minecraft Bedrock addon port of the famous WorldEdit mod for Minecraft: Java Edition. The addon comes with custom commands to make building easier, and more fun! Not only are there commands, but also items to make it easier for anyone on any device to use this.
__Please note that this addon requires experimental features. To be on the safe side, make a backup of your world.__

## Installation
### Locally
First you must download the mcaddon file. You can find one in the [release section](https://github.com/SIsilicon/WorldEdit-BE/releases). After which, you open it with Minecraft and it will be imported into your game. Once there, choose a world you want to apply this addon to, and add the behaviour pack (the resource pack should apply automatically). The "Beta APIs" experimental feature must also be enabled.

And that's it! Your world is ready for WorldEdit.

### Aternos server
To properly add this addon to the server, you first need to upload an already existing world with the required experimental features enabled (Do NOT add the addon to the world directly). You must then install the addon separately in the server's `packs` folder. Read more about how aternos handles addons and experimental features [here](https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/360042095232-Installing-Addons-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-) and [here](https://support.aternos.org/hc/en-us/articles/4407553257873-Enabling-experimental-gameplay-Minecraft-Bedrock-Edition-).

## Special Thanks
The backbone of this addon's code is a heavily modified version of notbeer's [GameTest API Wrapper](https://github.com/notbeer/Gametest-API-Wrapper).

And thanks to the original creator of the WorldEdit mod "sk89q" and [EngineHub](https://enginehub.org/) as a whole. They developed and excellent mod, and I'm just simply making a version of it work on bedrock. They're the real heroes. :)
